Overview:

This project focuses on predicting weather conditions using Ridge Regression, a machine learning technique known for handling multicollinearity and overfitting in regression models. 

Goals:

Implement Ridge Regression to predict weather conditions.

Explore different predictive ratios: month_max, month_day_max, max_min, monthly averages, and daily averages.

Identify temperature_max as the major influencing factor in weather predictions.
